# EEG Experiment Participant Information

This page provides a brief overview of EEG and general study expectations. Upon arrival, you will receive a detailed information sheet and consent form specific to the study. These documents will explain the purpose and procedures in full, along with your rights as a participant. You will have the opportunity to review these materials and ask any questions before deciding to participate.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a safe, non-invasive technique used to measure natural electrical activity in the brain. Small sensors are placed on the scalp using a soft cap, and no radiation, or electrical currents are involved. The process is painless and widely used in both research and clinical settings.

## What to Expect During the Session

Your session will begin with a brief preparation phase. A researcher will fit a soft, stretchy cap with small sensors onto your scalp. To ensure clear recordings, a water-based gel will be applied to the sensors; this gel is harmless and washes out easily after the session. You’ll then be seated comfortably in a quiet room.

During the experiment, you may be asked to complete tasks such as watching images on a screen, listening to sounds, or responding to prompts. These activities are designed to be simple and straightforward. To help us capture the best data, we’ll ask you to stay as still as possible during recordings. Depending on the study, the session itself will take approximately one to two hours, and you’ll have the opportunity to take short breaks if needed.

Once the session is complete, the cap will be removed. You’re welcome to use our facilities to wash your hair afterward. Feel free to bring a towel, hairbrush or hat for after the session.

## Risks and Benefits

Participating involves minimal risk. You might experience mild discomfort from the cap or the gel, but this is temporary and easily adjusted. The primary benefit of this study is your contribution to scientific knowledge. If applicable: You will also receive SONA credits (one hour = one credit, in 15 minute increments) for your time.

## Your Data & Privacy

All data collected during the session will be anonymized and stored securely. While results may be shared in publications or presentations, no personal information will be linked to the data.

## Voluntary Participation

Your participation is entirely voluntary. You are encouraged to ask questions at any time, and you’re free to withdraw from the study without penalty or explanation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will the gel damage my hair?
No. The gel is water-soluble and washes out easily with shampoo. 

### What if I feel uncomfortable during the session?
Your comfort is our priority. Simply inform the researcher, and we’ll pause or stop the session immediately.
